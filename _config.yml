  desc: "Ph.D. student in Stanford's Vision and Learning Lab (SVL) studying efficient video understanding where I'm co-advised by Juan Carlos Niebles and Jiajun Wu.
Prior to this I was a M.Sc.Eng. Student at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, where I researched for over 2 years, with emphasis in Machine Reasoning, Meta Learning and Adaptive Computation Time models.
Additionally I was a teaching assistant for the courses Artificial intelligence, Deep Learning, and the Capstone for Software Engineering majors, as well as teacher in the same institution's AI diploma course.
I'm passionate about the outdoors (ultra-running, skiing, hiking, etc!) and scientific innovation."  # Describe yourself.
