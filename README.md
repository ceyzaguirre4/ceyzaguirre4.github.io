#Â Personal Page + Blog

Based on [Jalpc](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc) and layout inspired by [chihyaoma](https://chihyaoma.github.io).

Made a series of modifications and additions (latex, D3, HD banners, etc), but basically ruined the translation and donation functionality in the process.

# TODO:

- fix image paths (move images to static)-
- move gridmap static to static folder
- currently just commented googleadsense in index and head html files.
- find out why I need to comment out the `shortcut icon` (and how to add it back)
